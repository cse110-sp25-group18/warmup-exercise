        <h1>Rules</h1>

        <h2>Object of the Game</h2>
        <p class="rule nunito-regular">
            The player attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 
            as possible, without going over 21.
        </p>

        <h2>Card Values</h2>
        <p class="rule nunito-regular">
            The player can choose whether an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 
            worth 10 points. Each number card is worth its number.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Betting
        </h2>
        <p class="rule nunito-regular">
            Before the deal begins, each player places a bet. Minimum and maximum 
            limits are established on the betting.
        </p>

        <h2>
            The Deal
        </h2>
        <p class="rule nunito-regular">
            When the player has placed their bet, the dealer gives one card face up 
            to the player, and then one card face up to themselves. Another card of 
            is then dealt face up to the player, but the dealer takes the second 
            card face down. Thus, the player receives two cards face up, and the 
            dealer receives one card face up and one card face down.
        </p>

        <h2>
            The Play
        </h2>
        <p class="rule nunito-regular">
            The player goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for 
            another card) or "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer 
            to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). Thus, the player may stand on 
            the two cards originally dealt to them, or they may ask the dealer for 
            additional cards, one at a time, until deciding to stand on the total 
            (if it is 21 or under), or goes "bust" (if it is over 21). In the latter 
            case, the player loses and the dealer collects the bet wagered.
        </p>

        <h2>
            The Dealer's Play
        </h2>
        <p class="rule nunito-regular">
            When the dealer has served the player, the dealers face-down card is 
            turned up. If the total is 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 
            or under, they must take a card. The dealer must continue to take cards 
            until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand. If 
            the dealer has an ace, and counting it as 11 would bring the total to 17 
            or more (but not over 21), the dealer must count the ace as 11 and 
            stand. The dealer's decisions, then, are automatic on all plays, whereas 
            the player always has the option of taking one or more cards.
