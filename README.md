## Game Rules

Blackjack is a popular card game where the goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

### Basic Rules
- Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value
- Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10 points
- Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, whichever is more beneficial
- If a player's hand exceeds 21 points, they "bust" and lose the game
- If a player gets exactly 21 points, they have a "blackjack" which typically pays at higher odds

### Game Flow
1. The game begins with both the player and dealer receiving two cards. All player cards are face up, while only one dealer card is visible
2. The player can choose to "hit" to receive additional cards, or "stand" to keep their current hand
3. After the player stands, the dealer reveals their hidden card and draws according to fixed rules (typically must hit on 16 or below, stand on 17 or above)
4. The hand closest to 21 without busting wins; equal points result in a tie
